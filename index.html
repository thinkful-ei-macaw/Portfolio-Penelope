      <h2 class="center">Thinkful Beginner</h2>

      <p class="large">I am a student web developer. I continue to learn, daily, how to be productive in this type of
        field. I have accomplished and completed many projects such as the quiz and bookmark app. My education and
        experiences are completely different than those of a software developer. I have an Associates Degree from the
        University of Phoenix in Criminal Justice and I worked 15 years in law enforcement.
      </p>


      <p class="large">My health and lifestyle has placed me in a position to change my career and my path for
        success.
        My investments in laptops, desktops, tablets, and iPad causes me to
        have an obsession in exploring the fundamentals of web development. I am always finding creative ways of web
        design.
      </p>


      <p class="large">Having hands-on experience has been fascinating. I want to establish my own contract business
        and remotely work with a team of programmers. I would like to help others to create their own web designs or
        business apps. I could see myself in the future creating and publishing the work I have done for other people
        and
        businesses.

          <p class="large w3-text-black text-medium "> I created a quiz app with one of my classmates. We came
            up with something that we both enjoy watching.
            I believe I was more of a fan when we came up with the app for "The Walking Dead" Fan quiz.
            We started this quiz app with the flex-box method,using JavaScript,
            HTML, CSS, and JSON.
