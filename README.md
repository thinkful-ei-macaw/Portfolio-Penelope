# Portfolio-Penelope
03/03/2020
I had to keep this basic and by the book , due to the spellchecks, style, and code including formatting. 
The Portfolio is in a box mobile designed by the start wire frame HTML from the checkpoint. 
I went through tutorials on how to use the https://validator.w3.org HTML/CSS checker and was able to clear up some 
errors in my codes.   Stayed with my color, patterns, and made sure my projects were linked and performed correctly. 
My links to my personal sites are accessible and no other changes were made to the links.
