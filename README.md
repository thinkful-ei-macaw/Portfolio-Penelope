Check Mark >>>>>
The page layout is simple for visitors understand; it's easy to navigate the site and find what I'm looking for.
You've made good use of font sizes and typography.
You've included a good summary of at least one project you've completed.
The portfolio is responsive and works on a range of screen sizes.
The content of the About section says a lot in very few words, which is great!
You've included a mailto link as well as links to your GitHub and LinkedIn pages.
I can fully navigate the portfolio using my keyboard (which is important for accessibility).
There are no errors shown in the browser's Dev Tools console.

You used semantic HTML elements rather than just div elements.
The app was built from scratch.
Your projects are easy to see.

Your code passes the HTML validator.
A number of the reported typos have been resolved.
The "mimosas and Tylenol" text no longer has a distinct background color.
The navbar no longer covers text, and is displayed on mobile.
Each of the projects now has the same width on the page.

Note: I had to change my whole entire portfolio to each individual
whom graded it. At this time, it has to be enough changes to pass
this check point , if not please let me speak with your supervisor
so we can resolve this grading issue.  I would like to catch up and
be able to pass the next check point. Thank You.
